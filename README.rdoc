Uses PhantomJs and Nokogiri for scraping.

Creates a searchable database of baseball players, including minor leagues and top 30 prospects per team.

To set up the database, open a rails console and run TeamScraper.scrape! NOTE: It may be necessary to run the scraper multiple times to ensure that all teams are captured.

Using the roster model, users can also load in current fantasy rosters. Currently this requires a seperate file for each user, and that the file contains player names on seperate lines.

Positions - Currently positions are only loaded for players who have been claimed by a user, as it helps for display on each users team page.
